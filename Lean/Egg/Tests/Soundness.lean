import Egg

-- Tests containing examples of backend soundness issues.

-- TODO: This started breaking when we added more in depth reporting on why egg failed. I don't
--       understand how that's related at all, except that we now also parse the explanation even
--       when we don't do proof reconstruction, so this test case might have had this exact error
--       all along.

-- In this example egg finds a proof, but we're not performing proof reconstruction (which would be
-- impossible) as a result of setting `exitPoint := some .beforeProof`.
